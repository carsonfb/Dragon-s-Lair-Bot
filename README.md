Dragon's Lair Bot
===============

This program is a simple bot written in AutoIt that plays the game Dragon's Lair from the 1980s.

Installation
------------
1. You will need a copy of Dragon's Lair in order to do anything meaningful with this bot.  I
bought my copy from [gog.com](https://www.gog.com/game/dragons_lair_trilogy).

2. The game must be played at a resolution 1920x1080.  You can, of course, change the coordinates
in the source code to allow for another resolution, but only 1920x1080 is supported
"out-of-the-box".

3. Ensure that you have AutoIt installed if you wish to make changes to the code.  Otherwise, you
can run the 32-bit or 64-bit compiled binary located in the bin folder.
